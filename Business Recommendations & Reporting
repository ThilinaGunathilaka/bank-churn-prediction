### 🎯 7.1. Key Findings

| Insight                                         | Explanation                                                         |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🧓 **Older customers are more likely to churn** | Age is a top SHAP feature. Possibly due to less digital engagement. |
| 💰 **High-balance customers churn more**        | These are valuable customers — their loss impacts revenue.          |
| ❌ **Inactive members are at high risk**         | Customers not using services regularly are more likely to leave.    |
| 🧍 **Customers with fewer products churn more** | Lower product engagement correlates with higher churn.              |
| 🌍 **Churn varies by country**                  | E.g., Germany might show higher churn rates than France or Spain.   |
| 💳 **Credit card ownership has mixed impact**   | May depend on how cards are promoted or used.                       |

### 💡 7.2. Actionable Recommendations

#### 1. **Target High-Value, High-Risk Customers**

* Use churn scores to **prioritize outreach** to high-balance customers who are inactive.
* Offer **retention packages** (e.g., loyalty rewards, concierge banking).

#### 2. **Encourage Multi-Product Usage**

* Create bundles that encourage customers to use multiple services (e.g., savings + investment + credit).

#### 3. **Engage Inactive Users**

* Launch automated reminders, app usage incentives, or free consultation offers to keep them active.

#### 4. **Customize Retention by Region**

* For countries with higher churn (e.g., Germany), investigate **local satisfaction surveys** or **competitive offers**.
* Localize campaigns and address regional needs.

#### 5. **Monitor Aging Customer Segments**

* Provide tech support or simplified digital experiences for older clients.
* Promote services tailored for retirement planning.
